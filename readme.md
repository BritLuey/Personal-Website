# Louis Rozier

Welcome to [LouisRozier.com](https://www.louisrozier.com)! I'm Louis, and this is my personal website where I share my projects, ideas, and insights.

## About

At the beginning of 2025, I decided to rebuild my personal website to better reflect my evolving interests and skills. After just an hour of research, I settled on creating something that is **simple and low-maintenance**, yet **creative, fun, unique, and practical**.

This entire project took around eight hours, encompassing ideation, design, the production of art assets, and, most importantly, several hours of solid programming. I'm really pleased with how it turned out and excited about the future enhancements planned for the site.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework:** [Nuxt 3](https://nuxtjs.org/) / [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)
- **Languages:** JavaScript, CSS, LESS

### Backend

- **API:** Built using [Nuxt Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/)

### Package Management

- **Package Manager:** [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) for its speed and efficiency

## Future Plans

I'm planning to implement the following enhancements:

- Optimizing the minigame for better performance and user experience.
- Adding a simple CMS to make content updates even more straightforward.

Stay tuned for these updates and more as I continue to develop and refine the website!
